            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            
            <p>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.
            In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with the marinade ingredients: yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
            In a large pot, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the fried onions from the pot and set aside for garnishing.
            To the remaining onions in the pot, add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant.
            Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until it changes color and is lightly browned.
            Stir in the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften.
            Reduce the heat to low and add the plain yogurt, mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Stir well to combine.
            Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Gently mix the rice with the chicken and spices until well combined.
            Pour in the water and increase the heat to high. Bring the mixture to a boil.
            Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the flavors are well infused.
            Remove the pot from the heat and let it rest, covered, for another 10 minutes to allow the steam to continue cooking the rice.
            Fluff the rice gently with a fork to separate the grains. Garnish with the reserved fried onions.
            Serve the biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and enjoy!You can also add saffron strands soaked in warm milk for a vibrant color and aromatic flavor. Additionally, you can customize this recipe by adding vegetables or using different types of meat or seafood instead of chicken.</p>
